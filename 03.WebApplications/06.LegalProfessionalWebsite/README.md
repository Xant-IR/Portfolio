## Software Architecture

The Legal Professional Website project is structured into multiple layers including Core, MVC, Persistence, and Tests projects.

- **Core:** This layer contains the core business logic and domain models of the application.
  
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** Responsible for handling user requests, rendering views, and interacting with the Core layer to execute business logic.
  
- **Persistence:** Handles data storage and retrieval using a repository pattern. Utilizes Entity Framework Core for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and interacts with the underlying database.
  
- **Tests:** Includes unit tests and integrated tests for ensuring the reliability and functionality of the application.
  
### Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern:** Used to abstract data access logic and provide a consistent interface for interacting with data sources.
  
- **Unit of Work Pattern:** Coordinates multiple repository operations within a single transaction, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

### Testing

- Controllers and repositories are unit tested using an in-memory database to simulate data interactions. 
- Integrated tests are performed to validate the functionality of the application components as a whole.
